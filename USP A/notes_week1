file types:
- : regular file
d : directory
b : device drivers block
c : device drivers character
l : symbolically linked file
s : socket
p : named pipe
D : only solaris

every user will normally have an entry in /etc/passwd
username:x or password encrypted:user id:group id:doc string:home directory:login shell

users belong to groups
/etc/groups

file permissions:
r
w
x
t
s : set effective user
    only for binary execucatable files
    user running this pgm will become as powerful as the owner of the file
when we create a file, the permissions depend on the umask
file : 666 ^ ~umask
use chmod to modify the permissions

ln : creates another name for the same file
a) ease of use: a file can be made to occur in mutliple directories
b)  diff outputs for the same cmd
c) porting : use the same name for a software even if the version changes

three time stamps:
access time : read the file
modification time : modify the file content
change time : modify the file attribute

ln :
cannot link across the file system
cannot link directories


system call:
request to the kernel
executes in the kernel mode
user pgm cannot directlya access what is the kernel mode
context switch from the user mode to the kernel mode and
	back again
function called system is different
system call looks like a normal fn in most of the languages
gives a minimal interface
all output fns in turn call the system call write

system call could fail:
----------------------------------------------------------

file system:
first char in the first field of the output of ls -l cmd:
file types:
-   : regular file
d   : directory
c   : character oriented device drivers
b   : block oriented device drivers
l   : symbolic link
s   : socket
p   : named pipe

every user will have an entry in /etc/passwd
username:x or password encrypted:uid:gid:doc str:home directory:login shell

file permissions:
r w x -
t : sticky
s : set user bit (effective user)
    any user running a pgm with set user bit will have the permission
    of the owner of the file - becomes effectively the owner

initial permission depends on umask
use chmod to change the permissions

ln : link
a) ease of use : file can exist in diff directories
b) same binary may have diff names resulting in diff outputs
c) porting

cannot be used on directories
cannot be used across the file system
