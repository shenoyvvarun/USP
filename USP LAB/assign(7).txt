1. Write a program to combine the streams stdout and stderr into a single file.

void foo()
{
	write(1, "this goes to stdout\n", 20);
	write(2, "this goes to stderr\n", 20);
	write(1, "abcdefghijklmnopqrs\n", 20);
	write(2, "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS\n", 20);
 
} 

2. Experiment signals on fork and exec.
   timer
      setup a timer - setup handler for the timer - fork (or exec) - check
      who gets the timer signal

3. implement client - server communication using pipes.
   client sends a string
   server makes the first char uppercase and sends it back
   hint: require two pipes
