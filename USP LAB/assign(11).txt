semaphore:
1. Implement a barrier using a counting semaphore.
   Parent process creates n child processes - avoids zombie by
   explicitly setting the disposition to SIG_IGN.
   - blocks on a semaphore by doing a p operation in a loop executed n times.
   each child at the end does a v operation at the end.
   When all the children complete execution, parent continues.

2. Experiment with IPC_NOWAIT. Make a process execute a p operation which
   would normally block.

3. Check whether otime is changed if the semop is blocked.
