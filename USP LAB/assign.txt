a)
	find the output of this program. Convince yourself and your teacher about it!
How many processes are created in this snippet?
int main()
{
   fork();
   fork() && fork () || fork ();
   fork ();
   printf("fool\n");
   return 0;
}
b)
	what happens in this program if you are the running the program
        in the following ways?
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main()
{
        printf("abcd\n");
        fork(); // assume successful forking!
        printf("pqrs\n");
        return 0;
}
   i) run the pgm as it is
   ii) remove the new line in the first printf and try it
   iii) re-introduce the new line in the first printf and run the pgm
        as  ./pgm >out
        check what is stored in the file out

c) 
Write a program in which the parent displays uppercase chars A -Z and child displays lowercase chars a-z with a delay on max of 2 seconds bet each character.
Run the program repeatedly and see if there is racing.
