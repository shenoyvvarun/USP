
a. Write a program which takes a command with arguments on the command line and executes it.
   ./mypgm  ls -l -i
   this should execute the ls cmd.
   hint: experiment with execvp call

b. while(1)
   {
	int pid  = fork();
        if(pid < 0)
        {
             perror("fork"); exit(1);
        }	
        else if(pid)
        {
            printf("I am the parent\n");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("I am the child\n");
        }
   }
   Please do not execute this code.
   What happens if this program is executed?


c. experiment with environmental variable. create an environmental 
   variable. fork and check whether the variable is available in
   both the parent and the child. Change in the child and check whether
   the variable has changed in the parent. Now change in the parent
   and check whether the variable has changed in the child.
   What do you conclude?
